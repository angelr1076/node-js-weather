# node-js-weather
Node.js weather app.
The app also uses handlebars. I used this to practice creating routes and have several APIs work together inside of Node. 

1. If you'd like to run the app locally, clone or download it first. 
2. Once the app is cloned, from the terminal, make sure you're in the root terminal and type in "npm run start" without the quotes.
3. Voila! You're up and running!
